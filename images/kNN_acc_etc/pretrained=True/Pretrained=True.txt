There might be an adaptation phase where the model's weights adjust from the pre-trained state 
to the new task. During this phase, performance metrics can fluctuate and might temporarily degrade before improving.


Pre-trained weights provide a strong prior that might initially restrict the model's ability to explore the data distribution of the new task. 
This can result in lower performance in the early stages of training as the model adjusts.
When starting from scratch, the model has no such priors and might be more adaptable initially, even though it will likely be less optimal overall without extensive training.
